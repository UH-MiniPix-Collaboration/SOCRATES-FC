# HASP 2019 Flight Computer

This program uses MiniPIX analysis software originally created by Andrew Walker at
https://github.com/andrewi66doe/MiniPIX-RPI-Dosimeter.

This module has been integrated with serial communication code that we will
require for the operation of our flight computer and well as various logging and
data collection facilities.
